Welcome to NeverBounce's Python SDK!  We hope that it will aid you in consuming
our service.  Please report any bugs to the github issue tracker and make sure
you read the documentation before use.


Installation
------------

The preferred method of installation is with ``pip`` in a virtual environment::

    pip install neverbounce_sdk

If you must use ``easy_install``, you may.  If you'd like to install for local
development::

    git clone git@github.com:NeverBounce/NeverBounceApi-Python.git
    cd NeverBounceApi-Python
    pip install -e .

This will install ``neverbounce_sdk`` into the active environment in editable
mode.


Usage
-----

The NeverBounce Python SDK provides a simple interface by which to interact
with NeverBounce's email verification API version 4.  To get up and running, make sure
you have your API token on hand::

    import neverbounce_sdk
    token = 'my secret API token'
    client = neverbounce_sdk.client(auth=token)

And now you're ready to use the client.  You can check your account
information::

    info = client.account_info()
    # info is {'billing_type': 'default', 'credits': 12345, ... }

You can verify single emails::

    resp = client.verify('test@example.com')
    resp['result']              # 'invalid'
    resp['execution_time']      # 285

And you can create, query the status of, and control email verification bulk
jobs::

    emails = [
        {'email': 'tomato@veggies.com'},  # must have an 'email' key
        {'email': 'cucumber@veggies.com',
        'best_when': 'cold'},            # may contain arbitrary metadata
    ]
    job = client.create(emails)

    # all state-changing methods return a status object
    resp = client.parse(job['id'], auto_start=False)
    assert resp['status'] == 'success'

    client.start(job['id'])
    progress = client.status(job['id'])
    print(progress)  # dict with keys 'job_status', 'started', 'percent_complete', etc

All API operations return dictionaries with information about the execution of
the operation or the results of the operation, whichever is more appropriate.
The only exceptions are the ``client.search`` and ``client.results`` functions.
The response generated by these API endpoints is paginated; therefore these
functions return custom iterators that allow you to iterate across the API's
pagination::

    all_my_jobs = client.search()
    type(all_my_jobs)       # neverbounce_sdk.bulk.ResultIter
    for job in all_my_jobs:
        # process job
        # this loop will make API calls behind the scenes, so be careful!
        if all_my_jobs.page > 10:
            break

The ``ResultIter`` will pull down pages behind the scenes, so be careful!  A
``ResultIter`` will expose the raw API response as a ``data`` attribute, the
current page number as ``page``, and the total number of pages as ``total_pages``,
so you can use these attributes to implement finer-grained control over result
iteration.  Additionally, the methods ``raw_search`` and ``raw_results`` of the
client object will return the raw API response (this is the same as the ``data``
attribute of the ``ResultIter`` object).

Behind the scenes the client uses ``requests``, and if you would like to
explicitly provide a ``requests.Session``, you may do so::

    from requests import Session
    token = 'my secret token'
    session = Session()
    client = neverbounce_sdk.client(auth=token, session=session)

And all outgoing HTTP requests will be routed through the session object's
``request`` method, taking advantage of ``requests.Session``'s connection pooling.
You may provide any custom object that provides a ``request`` interface with the
same signature as that provided by ``requests.Session`` and a ``close`` method.

Finally, the client may be used a context manager.  If a session is provided,
it will be used for all connections in the ``with`` block; if not, a session will
be created.  Either way, a session associated with a client is **always**
closed at the end of the context block. ::

    with neverbounce_sdk.client() as client:
        client.auth = 'my secret token'

        # the client creates a session behind the scenes
        assert client.session is not None

        # do other stuff with the client

    # and then removes it at the end of the block
    assert client.session is None


See Also
--------

Documentation for each function of the client object is available through
Python's built-in ``help`` function, e.g.::

    >>> help(client.create)  # brings up a ton of information about the create
    ...                      # function's arguments and options

Many of the inputs and outputs of the client object's functions map fairly
closely to NeverBounce's raw v4 API, reading through the `official API
docs<https://developers.neverbounce.com/v4.0/reference#account>` will be
valuable in conjunction with using the built-in online help.
